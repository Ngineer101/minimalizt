In my career as a software engineer and leader, I’ve seen it all when it comes to landing pages - coded landing pages, CMS built, app builders, and various hybrid solutions.

The concept of a landing page is so simple - every business (online or not) needs one in the digital age. And yet, it's still a problem that haven't been completely solved by one tool or platform.

In this blog post I will share my experiences with these different approaches and the decision criteria I use to choose the right tool for the job.

## My recent experience with landing pages

When I started at [Swapfiets](https://swapfiets.nl/en-NL) 4 years ago, our landing page and bike pages were built in [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org). Then, due to limited functionality and knowledge within the company, we migrated to a custom built Next.js app where the landing pages and checkout flow could live on a single domain. This was ideal at the time since we had enough frontend developers to maintain the app and the entire flow was owned by our team. Now, we are back to using a CMS, this time [Framer](https://framer.com), in combination with Next.js for the checkout flow. This hybrid approach was chosen because there was a growing need from the marketing team to run their own experiments and have more freedom to build topic-specific landing pages.

At [Supermeme.ai](https://supermeme.ai) we started using a landing page builder and a separate blogging platform on our main domain, and hosted the Next.js app on a separate domain `app.*` domain. But, as we grew, we wanted to add search and meme editing functionality to the main domain for SEO purposes among other things so we decided to build all the landing pages, search pages, meme editor and the rest of the main app in a single codebase. Now everything lives in a Next.js monorepo. This is ideal because we can build free tools for marketing purposes and deploy it to our main domain for SEO benefits

## What are the considerations when creating a landing page?

Launching a new product or campaign almost always starts with the same question:
**“How do we get a polished landing page in front of users—fast?”**

Depending on the company, product, and skills in the team, different options are better suited.

### 1. Mapping the Landscape

| Option                           | TL;DR                                                            | Typical Users                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Website/Landing-Page Builder** | Hosted, visual editors (Framer, Webflow, Carrd).                 | Early-stage startups, marketers, solo founders |
| **CMS**                          | Content-first platforms (WordPress, Ghost, Strapi, Sanity).      | Content teams, SEO-driven companies            |
| **Custom-Coded**                 | Frameworks & static-site generators (Next.js, Astro, Rails).     | Product-led companies, engineering teams       |
| **Hybrid**                       | Mix of the above—e.g. builder for marketing pages, code for app. | Firms balancing speed & control                |

Before discussing pros and cons, let’s quickly clarify the differences.

#### Website & Landing-Page Builders

A builder is a _design_ tool that outputs HTML. Hosting, CDN, and updates are abstracted away. You work in a visual canvas, publish, and you’re live.

#### Content Management Systems (CMS)

A CMS separates _content_ from _presentation_. Editors write in an admin panel, developers style the front-end. Modern headless CMSs expose JSON APIs, so you can query content from any front-end stack.

#### Custom-Coded Pages

Here the team writes the site by hand (or with a framework). Every byte that reaches the browser is under your control—great power, great responsibility.

#### Hybrid

A hybrid stack is a mix of the above—e.g. builder for marketing pages, code for app.

### 2. Decision Criteria

Thinking about which way to go? It's not just about what looks coolest. Here are some key things to mull over before you pick your path. These questions usually help me narrow down the options pretty quickly:

1.  **Speed to Market: How Fast Do You Need This Thing?**
    Seriously, when does this landing page need to be live? Are we talking "yesterday was too late" to catch a fleeting market opportunity? Or do you have a few weeks to really polish things? Maybe your company culture is more "it's ready when it's absolutely perfect." Your timeline is a huge factor. If speed is paramount, some tools are naturally going to be a better fit than others that require more setup and development time.

2.  **Design Freedom: Pixel Perfect or "Good Enough"?**
    How much control do you *really* need over the look and feel? Does your brand have super-strict visual guidelines where every element, every pixel, has to be in *exactly* the right place? Or is a clean, professional-looking page that generally aligns with your brand identity good enough to get the job done? Some tools offer you god-like control over design, while others give you speed and simplicity through templates and pre-set options.

3.  **Content Workflow: Who's Driving This Thing Post-Launch?**
    Once the page is live, who's going to be in charge of updates? Will it be your marketing team, needing to frequently tweak headlines, swap out promotional banners, or launch new campaign variants on their own? Or will updates mostly be handled by developers as part of a more structured code release process? Perhaps you'll have external writers or contributors who need a dead-simple way to get their content in. The answer dramatically shapes how easy it needs to be for non-technical folks to make changes.

4.  **SEO & Performance: Chasing Google and Speed?**
    How vital is it for your page to rank high in Google search results? And how critical is it for the page to load lightning fast for your users? Will advanced SEO tactics like structured data (to get those fancy rich snippets in search results), or acing Google's Core Web Vitals (CWV) scores, make a tangible difference to your bottom line? For some businesses, organic search and top-notch performance are everything; for others, they might be secondary concerns.

5.  **Scalability & Extensibility: Just This Page, or World Domination?**
    What are your ambitions for this landing page, and for your web presence in general? Is this a simple, one-off page for a specific campaign that will be taken down in a few months? Or is it the humble beginning of something much bigger? Are you dreaming of adding a comprehensive blog, interactive free tools to generate leads, a members-only section with exclusive content, or complex integrations with your backend systems down the road? It's wise to think a few steps ahead, even if you're starting small.

6.  **Team Skill Set: What Superpowers Do You Have In-House?**
    Let's be honest about the skills you have readily available within your team (or your budget for freelancers/agencies). Do you have a crack team of experienced software engineers eager to build something custom and tailored to your exact needs? Or is your team more marketing-centric, where a "no-code" or "low-code" solution is the only practical way to get things built and launched efficiently right now?

7.  **Total Cost of Ownership: More Than Just the Sticker Price!**
    When you're looking at costs, don't just compare the monthly subscription fees of different tools. You need to consider the *total* cost over time. This includes the cost of developer hours if you go the custom route or need to build integrations. What about the "opportunity cost" – the potential lost revenue or missed chances if a chosen tool is too slow, too inflexible, or prevents you from launching a key feature when you need it? It all adds up.

Keep those lenses handy as we deep-dive into each approach.

### 3. Advantages & Drawbacks

#### 3.1 Landing-Page Builders

**Strengths**

- Zero setup—buy a domain, publish, you’re done.
- Visual editing empowers non-technical teammates; iteration cycles are minutes.
- Built-in animations, form handling, and hosting.

**Limitations**

- Opinionated. If you need a custom checkout, dynamic search, or a weird data model, you hit a wall.
- Content workflows remain basic; larger editorial teams quickly outgrow them.
- Vendor lock-in—exported code often isn’t production-ready.

**When a Builder Starts to Hurt**

- You need gated or personalized content (e.g. pricing experiments, logged-in dashboards).
- SEO requirements go beyond meta tags—think programmatic pages or schema.org markup.
- Security reviews demand single-sign-on, audit trails, or a dedicated VPC.

#### 3.2 Traditional or Headless CMS

**Strengths**

- Rich editorial features: roles, revisions, scheduled posts.
- SEO plugins, image optimization, multilingual support out of the box.
- With headless mode, you can pair a CMS back-end with any front-end.

**Limitations**

- Requires hosting and maintenance—or a paid SaaS tier.
- Visual freedom is harder: you work within themes or need a front-end engineer.
- Plugin ecosystems vary wildly in quality and security updates.

**Watch-outs**

- **Performance drift** – a jungle of plugins can bloat the DOM and TTFB. Audit regularly.
- **Security patching** – each third-party extension is a potential CVE you must monitor.
- **Content debt** – migrations become painful if authors rely on short-code hacks instead of structured fields.

#### 3.3 Custom Code

**Strengths**

- Unlimited flexibility—integrate payments, custom animations, realtime APIs.
- Performance can be tuned to the last kilobyte.
- A single codebase unifies product and marketing, easing experimentation (e.g. feature flags).

**Limitations**

- Slower initial velocity; you start at an empty repo.
- Every improvement (CMS interface, A/B testing) is a roadmap item your team must build or integrate.
- Ongoing dev costs; engineering time is your most scarce resource.

**Reality Checks**

- **Compliance** – If you need HIPAA, SOC 2, or region-locked data residency, custom code (plus strict infra) may be the only route.
- **Team topology** – Conway’s Law applies: a platform team will likely build a mono-repo; a marketing-led org gravitates toward SaaS tools.
- **Performance budgets** – Lighthouse 95+ scores are easier when you own the build pipeline.

### 4. The Hybrid Reality

In practice, most mature products converge on a hybrid stack:

_Swapfiets_ moved from WordPress → custom Next.js → **Framer (marketing) + Next.js (checkout)**. Marketers regained autonomy _and_ the product team kept full control of the transactional flow.

_Supermeme.ai_ began with a builder and a separate blogging SaaS, but SEO and product-led growth demanded native search and meme-editing on the root domain. The solution: consolidate **blog, landing pages, and app** into one Next.js monorepo, while still letting marketers tweak copy through a headless CMS.

Hybrids let you pick the best tool for each job—but they introduce integration overhead and multiple sources of truth. Automating deployments, analytics, and design tokens across systems deserves its own playbook.

### 5. A Simple Decision Framework

| Question                                                           | Likely Fit                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Need a page live this week, no devs available?                     | **Builder**                          |
| Strong content/SEO focus, moderate dev capacity?                   | **Headless CMS (+static front-end)** |
| SaaS product where the landing must share components with the app? | **Custom Code**                      |
| Marketing wants autonomy, product needs custom flows?              | **Hybrid**                           |

None of these answers are permanent. Re-evaluate at every funding round, traffic milestone, or strategic pivot.

### 6. Migration & Evolution Paths

Tooling choices are rarely permanent. Here is a pragmatic playbook for evolving without derailing growth:

1. **Prototype → Iterate**  
   Start with a builder to validate messaging. Freeze the design system tokens so colors and spacing match future stacks.
2. **Introduce a Headless CMS**  
   Once content volume grows, move copy into a headless CMS. Render it in the builder via embed/API calls to decouple authorship from design.
3. **Carve-out Interactive Islands**  
   Need calculators or demos? Embed small React or Vue widgets. This keeps the main page in the builder while proving out custom logic.
4. **Full Re-Platform**  
   When conversion-critical features demand tighter control, migrate the front-end to a framework (Next.js, Astro). Re-use the headless CMS so editors are unaffected.
5. **Unify Domains & Analytics**  
   Consolidate tracking, feature flags, and auth. Hybrid stacks succeed only when ops and data pipelines are centralized.

The key is incrementalism: **each stage delivers value on its own**, so the business is never waiting months for a “big-bang” relaunch.

**AI coding tools are changing the game**  
Modern assistants—GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT with code execution, and IDE plug-ins—make editing production code far less intimidating. A technically minded product manager or marketer can:

- tweak hero copy or button text directly in JSX/MDX and open a pull request in minutes,
- generate responsive CSS snippets or Tailwind classes without memorizing syntax,
- scaffold a new variant page by prompting “create a React component with A/B test hooks,”
- wire up simple APIs (e.g., newsletter signup → Airtable) with small code stubs the AI produces,
- convert designer-provided Figma specs into clean React or HTML sections.

With code review and CI guards in place, these lightweight edits rarely require a specialist front-end dev. That lowers the barrier to choosing a **code-first or hybrid** stack even when head-count is tight—and it keeps iteration speed high without surrendering long-term flexibility.

## Conclusion

The tooling spectrum exists for a reason. _Builders_ win on speed and design; _CMSs_ excel at structured content; _custom code_ maximizes flexibility; and _hybrid stacks_ aim for the sweet spot.

Ask what will unlock growth **right now** without painting you into a corner **later**. Make the trade-offs explicit, document them, and be ready to switch once the balance shifts. There is, and probably never will be, a one-size-fits-all solution—and that’s perfectly fine.
