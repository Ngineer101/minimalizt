AI has made code cheap. With the latest AI tools, you can literally build any feature you want in no time (yes really). But this newfound superpower comes with a trap: feature bloat.

Just because you _can_ build every feature doesn't mean you _should_ shove them all into your product.

Knowing what **not** to build is a critical skill - arguably more important than knowing what to build. It's a skill that may ultimately determine the success or failure of your product, especially if you're operating in a highly competitive market. Because reducing noise for your users increases focus. Focus increases engagement. And engagement... increases retention (and gives PM's bonuses).

## The feature bloat epidemic

The feature bloat phenomenon is already evident in the majority of SaaS products. Suddenly everything is "AI-powered," with AI features shoehorned into every corner of the product — even when it doesn't make sense at all.
Take **Snapchat**, for instance. They pinned "My AI" to the top of user inboxes, forcing a chatbot into a space reserved for intimate conversations with friends. Users hated it. Or consider **LinkedIn**, now cluttered with AI-generated "collaborative articles" that often feel like low-effort engagement bait rather than professional insight.
Most of these AI features add zero value to the product. They exist because some PM wanted to appear "innovative" and "forward-thinking" to hit arbitrary KPIs. The result? Cluttered products that confuse users rather than help them.

Now, before you think I'm being negative about AI - absolutely not. Most blog posts on this site make it clear that I'm incredibly bullish on AI. I just don't believe the world needs more bloated SaaS products with useless features shoved in everywhere without any consideration for whether they're actually useful.

## Learning from 37signals

The team at 37signals recently demonstrated this perfectly. They launched a new product called [Fizzy](https://fizzy.do) and decided to open source it. [From the git commit history](https://www.zolkos.com/2025/12/02/the-making-of-fizzy-told-by-git), it's clear that they initially added AI features to the product, realized it wasn't adding any value, and decided to rip all of it out.

Perfect! It's ok if AI is not useful in every single use case.

Everyone benefits in this case. The builders have fewer features to maintain and less complexity. The consumers get a more focused, valuable product without BS features forced in for some arbitrary purpose.

## Conclusion

In the age of AI, building is easy. The hard part is restraint.

The best products aren't the ones with the most features - they're the ones that do fewer things exceptionally well. In the age of AI, knowing what not to build might just be the most valuable skill you can develop as a product builder.
