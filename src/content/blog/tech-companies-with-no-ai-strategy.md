In the year 2005, businesses like Blockbuster (or Mr. Video if you lived in South Africa like me) and Gamestop flourished. No mall was complete without one of these stores and for many, the highlight of the week was renting the latest DVD to watch at home. Back then, the internet was still a novelty and not nearly as accessible as it is today. Then, slowly at first, everything changed.

Suddenly, renting physical DVDs and games was no longer the only option. Online streaming services like Netflix and Hulu emerged, offering a more convenient and accessible way to watch movies and TV shows. These services didn't just compete with DVDs; they fundamentally changed how people consumed entertainment.

And, sadly, these companies failed to adapt to the changing times.

## Adapt or die

The year is 2025 but the age-old saying in business still rings true - "_adapt or die_". And it is more relevant than ever before.  If your tech company doesn't have a coherent AI strategy, you're effectively setting up shop like a brick-and-mortar store in 2005, just as the e-commerce tidal wave was about to hit.

Back then, many physical retailers dismissed the internet as a fad or a niche channel. We all know how that story ended for giants like Blockbuster, Borders, and countless others who failed to adapt. And while a lot of people realize the incredible value that AI can bring, many businesses still haven't structurally included AI tools in their work and processes.

As with the emergence of the internet, today, Artificial Intelligence is undergoing a similar transition from a novel technology to a foundational layer of the digital world. As Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke has emphasized, integrating AI isn't just an option; it's becoming a fundamental expectation for how modern software and services should operate. Customers and users will increasingly demand AI-powered features, smarter interfaces, and personalized experiences.

## I'm selling physical products, why do I need AI?

You might be asking, "I sell physical products, why do I need AI?". While AI won't likely directly replace your physical products, there are numerous ways to leverage AI to your advantage. And this where having an AI strategy will differentiate you from your competitors.

Parts of your business that can be transformed by AI include:

- Customer service
- Inventory management
- Supply chain optimization
- Product recommendations
- Fraud detection

Where you previously had to hire big teams of people to take care of each department, you can now leverage AI together with fewer specialist roles to automate big parts of these processes. AI will definitely not replace your entire workforce, but it can help you to operate more efficiently.

Smaller teams of specialists can now focus on the most critical tasks, while AI handles the routine and repetitive work. This not only reduces costs but also frees up your team to focus on more creative and value-adding activities.

## Don't be caught off guard

The development of AI and the possibilities it creates make the world of tech and business even more competitive and fast-paced. What gave your company a competitive edge in the past might not be enough to keep you ahead in the future. And the longer you wait to adapt to this new reality of work, the more you risk falling behind.

## Conclusion

In the age of AI, adaptation means more than just dabbling; it requires a clear vision, strategic investment, and a willingness to fundamentally rethink how value is created and delivered. Those who wait too long might find themselves the digital equivalents of empty storefronts.
