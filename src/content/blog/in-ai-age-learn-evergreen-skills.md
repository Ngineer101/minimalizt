At this point, the capabilities of AI are well known among tech folks, and it's clear that a lot of white-collar work (coding, accounting, customer support, etc.) will be largely automated by AI in the near future.

And even if AI won't automate a part of your work, it will most certainly influence the way you work.

So, is it possible to hedge yourself against becoming irrelevant in the AI-future?

I'd like to think it is. While it is very important to learn how to leverage AI tools to your advantage, there are also other valuable skills worth learning in this time. Some essential (human) principles that will always benefit you regardless of the tools and technology that arise.

## Simple, clear communication

Whether you are communicating with another human or giving instructions to a large language model (LLM), simple, clear communication will always be the foundation of what you do. It makes collaboration with other people significantly easier. In fact, you will also get infinitely better results when you can communicate in a simple, clear, but effective way with an LLM. And while good communication skills may sound like a simple skill to learn, it is something that most people still ignore when focusing on their professional development.

In an ever-evolving work environment, being able to adapt and improve your communication style is essential. It will help you navigate misunderstandings and feedback with a constructive mindset. And it will help you stay relevant as language, technology, and workplace norms evolve.

## Being adaptable in a changing world

One core strength of the human race is our ability to adapt to changing environments. And in the next few years, AI will inevitably change many aspects of your work and daily life. By being open to this change and embracing new ways of working, you can stay relevant and continue to grow in your career.

The hardest part is being open to this change and not fearing the unknown. But in the end, those who can adapt the best to these changes will thrive.

## Building relationships both online and offline

There's a common saying that "***it's not about what you know, but who you know***". This is true for business and personal relationships. And, fortunately, AI can't build relationships on your behalf. When given the choice, *99.9% of people still choose to socialize and interact with real humans instead of some computer interface.

Building relationships is underrated in the age of AI, but it is irreplaceable. Whether you are networking in person or connecting with others online, relationships provide emotional motivation, open doors to new opportunities, and enrich your understanding and skills.

## Breaking down complex problems

Currently, LLMs are not that good with breaking down a complex problem into smaller parts and solving each part individually (although it's making huge progress in that direction). But the ability to analyze a problem, think critically about a solution, and solving it in smaller parts is an immensely valuable skill. And it's a skill, when mastered, that can be exponentially aided with the use of AI.

Good old-fashioned logical problem-solving skills will always be irreplaceable. Whether you are working on a complex project or a simple task, the ability to break down a problem and solve it step by step is a skill that will continue to be valuable in the future.

## Conclusion

In the age of AI, it's essential to focus on learning skills that will remain relevant regardless of the tools and technology that arise. Simple, clear communication, adapting to change, building relationships, and the ability to break down a complex problem into smaller parts are irreplaceable skills that will continue to be valuable in the future.
