For the past three years, I've led two dev teams at Swapfiets, made up of cross-functional developers and QA engineers. As a first-time lead, I learned some lessons the hard way. In this post, I share the most important takeaways, mistakes, and realizations from my journey so far.

Most of these seem obvious in hindsight, but when you're juggling work and leadership responsibilities, it's easy to lose sight of them.

## Hire the right people (who actually care)

This might sound like a cliché, but it's true: hire people who care. [Or as Alexandr Wang put it](https://alexw.substack.com/p/hire): "Hire people who give a shit." People should be proud of their work and invested in what they do.

**_And by "giving a shit" about work, I don't mean working 12-hour days, 6 days a week until you burn out._** But it is sometimes necessary to walk the extra mile to get a project over the line. This is way easier to do when you care about your work.

As a first time lead, I was fortunate enough to be part of the hiring process of many of my team members, either as being the hiring manager and helping out with interviews as a senior engineer (before I got promoted). I'd love to say that we always ended up hiring the perfect people, but that would be wishful thinking. Fortunately, most hires were succesful and we were able to build a high-performing team.

After having done more than 40 interviews in the past 3.5 years, these are the things that were really strong signals for success (besides doing a moderately complicated technical assignment):

- **Being able to have a constructive discussion despite differing opinions** - this is something that you will inevitably encounter when working with someone who really cares about their job (see next section about opinions and disagreements). And it's fairly easy to evaluate during a code review session of the technical assignment. If someone can constructively defend their opinion with good arguments without being married to their POV, it's a great sign.

- **Being curious and eager to learn new things** - being able to teach yourself new skills is crucial for being successful in the tech industry. Every good engineer tinkers with something at home or plays around with some exotic tech. Ask them about side-projects or things they built. It's not the end of the world if they don't have any side-projects to share, but it's a strong positive signal if they do.

- **Being able to communicate simply and effectively** - whether it's written, spoken, sang, or hymned, communication ultimately forms the basis of any working relationship. Your ability to effectively collaborate with someone is directly dependent on how effectively you can communicate through various mediums. This can be evaluated in all the steps of the hiring process, from writing a cover letter, having a video call, to doing a peer code review. If communication with someone doesn't go smoothly, it's a red flag.

A note on hiring in the AI era: most of these interviews were done before AI tools became mainstream. Today, I would add a requirement for evaluating the effective use of AI tools, as it's quickly becoming a core competency.

As I got more settled in my role over the past years, I realized most people don't need to be "managed" in the traditional sense - checking deadlines, chasing tasks, etc. What they need is leadership. If you hire intrinsically motivated people, give them a clear goal and direction, and allow them the freedom to solve interesting problems, they'll thrive. Your job as a manager is to guide them - on career growth, product roadmaps, and tech decisions - not micromanage their day-to-day work.

Hire good people, enable them to take ownership, and your product will flourish. With the right team, it won't feel like managing at all. Instead, it becomes collaboration, where everyone works toward a shared goal.

## Disagreement is healthy (and sometimes necessary)

Differing opinions are part of life, especially in field of software engineering. Everyone has a favorite language, framework, or tool they swear is the best. Software engineers are notoriously opinionated, and that's okay.

You don't have to agree with everyone, and not everyone will agree with you. In fact, if your team never disagrees with you as a manager, that's a huge red flag. It could mean they don't trust you enough to voice their opinions or don't feel safe doing so. Either way, it's a problem.

Disagreements, when handled constructively, lead to better decisions. They force you to think critically, consider alternative perspectives, and justify your choices. A team that debates ideas openly is a team that grows together.

But debating just for the sake of it isn't productive. Sometimes, as a manager, you have to step in and make a decision regardless of everyone's opinion. That's part of the job, and you have to accept that you can't keep everyone happy all the time.

### Handling strong opinions

Over the years, I've worked with some very opinionated people. Here's the heuristic I use to decide whether to say yes or no.

When we're debating multiple solutions or approaches, I ask:

- Does it benefit the team?
- Does it help achieve the project goals?
- Does it leave the team in a better state afterward?
- Is it worth the time and effort?

If I can answer yes to these questions for both approaches, then the ultimate choice doesn't matter. If one of these questions is a "no", then it's easy to motivate when a specific solution/approach is not needed.

Sometimes, you'll have to compromise for the greater good. And that's okay too. Leadership isn't about winning every argument; it's about making decisions that move the team forward.

## Tough conversations are part of the job

Another cliché: leadership isn't all sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes, you have to have tough conversations. Whether it's giving constructive feedback, addressing performance issues, or resolving conflicts, these talks are unavoidable. Clear communication is your best asset here, while poor communication is your biggest pitfall. Misunderstandings can escalate quickly, so always strive to be clear, concise, and empathetic.

What made a huge difference for me was always approaching these conversations with the right intentions - to help someone grow or achieve a shared goal. Most people are figuring things out as they go (just like you), so don't shy away from voicing your concerns or asking questions.

I've also learned that tough conversations are easier when you've built a foundation of trust. If your team knows you have their best interests at heart and share your vision, they're more likely to listen and be open to feedback.

Over the past few years I've had to have many of these tough conversations - from performance reviews, and helping some members switch careers, to telling a team member why they're not getting a promotion just yet (despite them feeling ready for it). What I tried to do during each of these conversations is to be as objective and concrete as possible while still being empathetic.

Especially the conversation around the promotion benefited from me being as concrete as possible. I explained to my team member that while they might feel ready for a promotion, there are still very concrete areas to improve, especially considering the level of seniority that they are aspiring to. Being as concrete as possible in this regard gave my team member confidence that I'm well aware of their current abilities and potential. And it made them realize that there is still some work necessary before taking the next step. We both walked away from that conversation with a renewed level of trust and motivation.

## Admit when you're wrong

Nobody's perfect. You'll make mistakes—it's inevitable. Admitting them can make you feel vulnerable, but how you handle them is what truly matters. Taking ownership of your mistakes builds trust and shows your team that you're human and willing to learn.

More importantly, this is one of your most significant opportunities to influence team culture. If you deflect blame, your team will learn to do the same, fostering a toxic environment. But if you use a mistake as an opportunity to demonstrate accountability, you create a culture where people feel safe to fail, learn, and grow.

For example, I once led a project to rebuild a checkout flow. It’s easy for "rebuilding" projects like these to get carried away with well-intentioned requests like “can you also fix this…”. My mistake was not being critical enough about these requests from the start. Two weeks before launch, it was clear we wouldn't meet the deadline. I sat down with the team, admitted my mistake in letting the scope grow, and we critically re-evaluated every task. We realized most could be postponed. By admitting the error and working together, we launched on time and learned a valuable lesson in scope management. This reinforced that we're a team that solves problems, not a team that assigns blame.

After all, innovation often comes from taking risks, and risks sometimes lead to failure. What matters is how you recover. That said, if you're making more mistakes than successes, this advice doesn't apply. Too many mistakes will erode trust, and rebuilding it will be an uphill battle.

## Final Thoughts

As a first-time lead three years ago, I felt pressured to always have everything under control and never make mistakes. I put a lot of pressure on myself to be "perfect" (whatever that means), but I soon realized that's a fool's errand. It's okay to not know everything all the time. What's important is to surround yourself with the right people, keep learning and growing, and be open to constructive change. The rest will follow.
