This past week I came across this post from Jason Fried (founder of 37signals and Basecamp): [https://x.com/jasonfried/status/1665885183839727616](https://x.com/jasonfried/status/1665885183839727616)

This was in the early stages of ChatGPT and Apple just launched their headset, Vision Pro.

It was a bet on different visions.

2 years later, it's clear that chat is the undisputed winner. AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and many have taken the world by storm - and all that with a simple chat interface.

The premise is simple - Ask what you want, AI gives you what you need.
Beyond flashy demos and marketing hype, chat interfaces strip away the noise and let you focus on solving problems. There's no steep learning curve—just ask and receive clear, contextual answers.

## The software interface revolution

The simplicity of this interface gave it the edge over all other visions. It simplifies technology in the way that it was always meant to be. And while we are still in the early stages of AI, I believe that the "chat" interface will define software for years to come. It gets out of your way, simplifies, actually helps, and is way faster.

Now you don't need complicated dashboards or queries anymore, simply ask AI to retrieve the data you need and BOOM - you're presented with a graph (with sources if you need to drill down).
Already, chat-powered bots handle customer support, troubleshoot code, and automate workflows. They evolve with each interaction, delivering ever-more relevant results.
Beyond customer support, chat-driven assistants integrate into IDEs, design tools, and collaboration platforms. Whether generating code snippets, brainstorming marketing copy, or summarizing lengthy reports, chat UIs streamline tasks across domains.

## Why chat will win (my opinion)

### Simplistic and easy to use

Chatting is the most natural software interaction. Dating back to instant messaging, it's familiar to billions. Compared to strapping on a headset and learning new gestures, typing a question is effortless and requires no special training.
Users can dive in with zero setup—chat interfaces democratize access to powerful AI.

### It's cheap and accessible

The Vision Pro's starting price is a staggering $3499. Compare that to the $20 - $30 per month that you pay for an incredible AI tool like ChatGPT or Claude. Especially considering you have to mount a headset on your face and unlearn everything that you know about interacting with a PC.
On top of low monthly fees, chat tools run in the cloud, eliminating hardware constraints and enabling instant scaling across devices.

### It requires fewer (almost no) behaviour changes

- it fits perfectly into the current work and professional environment
- it's hard to imagine an office where no desks or screens exist and people just wave their hands with awkwardly looking headsets on their heads.
This smooth transition into existing workflows accelerates adoption and drives real-world impact.

### Personalized and context-aware

Unlike static menus or one-size-fits-all UIs, chat adapts to individual preferences and maintains context across sessions. Your assistant learns as you interact, offering tailored suggestions that boost productivity and reduce repetition.

## Conclusion
Chat interfaces are more than a passing trend—they are redefining how we interact with software. By combining simplicity, affordability, and minimal behavior change, chat will continue to dominate the interface landscape. Whether you're querying data, writing code, or seeking creative inspiration, chat lets you get things done faster and more intuitively. The future of software is conversational, and it's available to everyone right now.
As chat interfaces continue to mature, we’ll see richer integrations—voice, vision, and real-time collaboration—yet the simple power of language will remain the central interface. Embracing chat-first design today sets us up for an even more seamless tomorrow.
